Welcome to the mbbox development environment!

Here are some tips:

* The code is located at ~/devel/

* Dev environment is set for the development of ansible based operator for OpenShift, for more info look at https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/operators/operator_sdk/osdk-ansible.html

* To test the operator in kubernetes cluster:
  # Build the image and upload it to quay
  # This needs to be done every time you made a change to container
  $ operator_sdk build quay.io/username/mbbox-operator
  $ docker push quay.io/username/mbbox-operator

  # Add the mbbox-operator to kubernetes cluster
  # This needs to be done only once
  $ oc create -f deploy/service_account.yaml
  $ oc create -f deploy/role.yaml
  $ oc create -f deploy/role_binding.yaml
  $ oc create -f deploy/operator.yaml

  # Verify the operator is up and running
  $ oc get deployment

* To debug kubernetes deployment here are a few tips
  * oc get all - help you see what is currently in kubernetes cluster
  * oc describe pod/<name> - will give you some overview
  * oc logs pod/<name> - will show you logs of the pod

Happy hacking!
